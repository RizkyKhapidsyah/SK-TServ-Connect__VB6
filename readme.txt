02/15/02 - tservconnect - Ok guys.  This one is SIMPLE.  Microsoft has already one all the work for you with the msrdp.ocx.  This probably isn't even worth releasing but someone actually asked me how it worked so I figured it may be of use to someone.  Maybe nice just to know that it exists.

This program will allow you to connect to a Windows 2000 Machine on Terminal Services, or any OS running Microsoft Terminal Services.  Note that you must have the included msrdp.ocx file registered on your system with regsvr32.exe.  The rest should be self explanatory.

If you have any questions, projects, contracts or job offers, or just want to say Hi!, feel free to send email to randy@onet.net.
